dbus-deviation
==============

dbus-deviation is a project for parsing D-Bus introspection XML and processing
it in various ways. Its main tool is dbus-interface-diff, which calculates the
difference between two D-Bus APIs for the purpose of checking for API breaks.
This functionality is also available as a Python module, dbusdeviation.

A second Python module, dbusapi, is provided for parsing D-Bus introspection
XML to produce an AST representing a D-Bus interface.

dbus-deviation’s API is currently unstable and is likely to change wildly.

Using dbus-deviation
====================

dbus-deviation can be used as a utility program or as a Python library.

The utility programs:
 • dbus-interface-diff:
     Check for differences between two versions of the same D-Bus API and
     print details of each difference. It can check for problems with forwards
     and backwards compatibility, as well as general informational
     differences.

     Example:
       dbus-interface-diff \
           com.example.Interface1.xml \  # old version of the interface
           com.example.Interface2.xml    # new version of the interface

As a library, the core object is an InterfaceParser, allowing a D-Bus API to
be parsed and represented as an AST. See the API documentation for more
explanation and examples.

Dependencies
============

 • argparse
 • xml.etree
